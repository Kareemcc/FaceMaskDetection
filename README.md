* research paper that provides a new dataset of masked faces (MAFA) and proposes a novel learning model locally linear embedding  cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks (LLE-CNNs)

* Literature review contains many Datasets for face detection learning with none to some degree of occulsion

* Literature review contains 3 main models of face detection 
    1. Boosting-based
    2. Deformable Part Model (DPM)
    3. Cascaded CNN

## Real-World Masked Face Datasetï¼ŒRMFD + recognition

* Research paper proposes a solution for Face recognition through occulsion and identifying if the person is wearing a mask as required

* Proposes 3 datasets (MFDD, RMFRD, SMFRD)
